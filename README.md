**Introduction**
This project focuses on developing a descriptive online examination system, which is a rare technology compared to the commonly used multiple choice question-based examination portals.
Unlike multiple choice questions, descriptive questions require the utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate answers written by examinees.

**Features**
Allows the creation and administration of descriptive exams.
Utilizes NLP techniques to evaluate written answers.
Designed for various examination purposes, including entrance examinations, olympiads, and placement tests.
Built with Django web framework for the backend.
Uses NLTK library for Natural Language Processing.
SQLite version 3 for database management.
Front-end developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

**Technologies Used**
Backend: Python, Django
Natural Language Processing: NLTK
Database: SQLite version 3
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript

**Installation**
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install Python and Django if not already installed.

Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.

Run the following command to install project dependencies:

Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8000.

**Usage**
Admins can create exams and questions through the Django admin interface.
Examinees can log in, view available exams, and submit their answers.
NLP algorithms evaluate the answers and assign marks accordingly.

**Future Enhancements**
Integration of advanced NLP techniques for more accurate evaluation.
Support for multimedia questions and answers.
Improved user interface and experienceAcknowledgments
The developers of Django, NLTK, SQLite, and other open-source technologies used in this project.
Inspiration from the need for a descriptive online examination system in educational and recruitment contexts.
